# Buf configuration version.
version: v2

# A list of modules included in the local workspace.
# Each module defines :
#
#   (1) the path to the directory where the Protobuf files are,
#
#   (2) optionally its name (which corresponds to a repository on the BSR), files or directories to
#       exclude, and module-level lint and breaking change settings.
#
# Both the path and any includes/excludes fields are relative to the root of the workspace.
modules:
  - path: .

# A list of dependencies on modules outside of the workspace.
# They're shared by all modules, and the manifest is stored in the buf.lock file.
#
# NOTE : Dependencies between the modules in the workspace are automatically handled by Buf and
#        shouldn't be declared here.
deps: []

# Workspace-level lint and breaking change detection settings.
# These settings are the default for all modules in the workspace unless specifically replaced in
# the module declarations.
lint:

    - STANDARD
