resources:
  ## Kubernetes allows decoupling policy decisions from the inner workings of the API Server by
  ## means of Admission Controller Webhooks, which are executed whenever a resource is created,
  ## updated or deleted. OPA Gatekeeper is a validating and mutating webhook that enforces CRD-based
  ## policies executed by Open Policy Agent, a policy engine for Cloud Native environments. In
  ## addition to the admission scenario, Gatekeeper's audit functionality allows admins to see what
  ## resources are currently violating any given policy. Finally, Gatekeeper's engine is designed to
  ## be portable, allowing admins to detect and reject non-compliant commits to an IAC system's
  ## source-of-truth.
